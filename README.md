# polymartbase
 A base Python discord bot for Polymart plugin verification

## Usage
 Clone this repository, create a Discord bot with the slash command permission, modify the base.py file, profit I guess?
 
 I will make a more detail guide on how to setup this bot later but for now see the comments ig.
